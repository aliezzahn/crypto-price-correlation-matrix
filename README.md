## How It Works

### Correlation Calculation

The application uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear relationship between cryptocurrency price movements. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:

- **1.0**: Perfect positive correlation (assets move identically)
- **0.0**: No correlation (assets move independently)
- **-1.0**: Perfect negative correlation (assets move in opposite directions)

### Color Interpretation

The matrix uses a color gradient to represent correlation strength:

- **Dark Blue**: Strong positive correlation
- **Light Blue**: Weak positive correlation
- **Red**: Negative correlation
